# The 30-Day "Be Good, Do Good" Challenge

## How to Use This Challenge

**Purpose**: Transform the principles in this book from ideas into daily practice.

**Instructions**:
1. Read one day's prompt each morning
2. Carry the principle with you throughout the day
3. Journal your reflection each evening
4. Be honest—this is for you, not performance

**Remember**: You won't be perfect. You'll miss days. You'll fail some challenges. That's not the point. The point is to keep returning to your compass.
