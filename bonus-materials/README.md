These materials were created to extend the wisdom shared in **"Be Good and Do Good: A Father's Message to His Child"** by Praveen Sattaru.

The book itself is a legacy letter from a son honoring his father's life of integrity, service, and sacrifice. These materials help readers create their own legacy by living these principles daily.

**Thank you to**:
- Praveen Sattaru for writing the book and sharing his father's wisdom
- All the fathers, mothers, mentors, and leaders who embody "Be Good, Do Good"
- Readers like you who choose to live with integrity
- Community contributors who share, adapt, and improve these resources

## ✨ Final Words

**These materials are tools, not destinations.**

Reading about integrity doesn't make you a person of integrity.  
Discussing values doesn't mean you live by them.  
Knowing the principles doesn't equal practicing them.

**The work is in the daily practice.**

**Your compass**: Be good. Do good.  
**Your tools**: These five resources.  
**Your choice**: Every day, every moment.

**May your anchor hold.**  
**May your rudder guide true.**  
**May your legacy be beautiful.**
