## For Book Clubs & Adult Discussion Groups

### Opening Ice Breaker
**Go around the circle**: "In one word, describe the father in this book. Why that word?"

---

### Discussion Questions by Theme

#### **THEME: Integrity (Chapters 1 & 2)**

**Question 1**: "The book defines 'Be good' as internal integrity and 'Do good' as external action. Which comes more naturally to you? Why?"

**Question 2**: "Share a time when you faced an integrity test—when you could have gotten away with something but chose not to. What influenced your choice?"

**Question 3**: "The author says 'You don't have to do good to BE good, but if you ARE good, you will DO good.' Do you agree? Can someone be internally good but not act on it?"

**Question 4**: "What are YOUR non-negotiable values? Have they changed over time?"

---

#### **THEME: Leadership in Hardship (Chapter 3)**

**Question 5**: "The book says 'The storm doesn't make you who you are; it reveals who you've always been.' When has a crisis revealed something about your character—positive or negative?"

**Question 6**: "Who is your 'storm crew'—the people you call when life is hard? How did you build those relationships?"

**Question 7**: "Discuss the difference between being strong IN a storm vs. being strong BECAUSE of a storm."

**Question 8**: "When have you seen someone lead with integrity during a crisis? What did you learn from them?"

---

#### **THEME: Legacy (Chapter 4)**

**Question 9**: "The three pillars of legacy are Humility, Loyalty, and Service. Rank them in order of importance for YOU. Explain your ranking."

**Question 10**: "The father funded siblings' educations and weddings instead of accumulating wealth. What sacrifices have you made for family? Would you make them again?"

**Question 11**: "The book asks: 'What will people actually say at your funeral?' Be honest—what would they say TODAY? What do you want them to say?"

**Question 12**: "Is legacy something you leave or something you build? What's the difference?"

---

#### **THEME: Service & Sacrifice (Chapter 5)**

**Question 13**: "What 'beautiful burdens' are you carrying right now? What makes them beautiful vs. toxic?"

**Question 14**: "The father served his country, his family, and his principles—often at personal cost. What are you willing to sacrifice for? What aren't you willing to sacrifice?"

**Question 15**: "How do we honor the people who carried burdens so we could be where we are? Share one person who sacrificed for you."

**Question 16**: "Discuss this statement: 'Privilege is not what you have—it's what you do with what you've been given.'"

---

#### **THEME: Wholeness (Chapter 6)**

**Question 17**: "The father was a military leader, a lawyer, and a poet. What seemingly opposite qualities do YOU hold? Do you show all sides or hide some?"

**Question 18**: "What parts of yourself do you suppress because they don't fit your 'role' (at work, in family, in society)?"

**Question 19**: "The book suggests we don't have to choose between strength and sensitivity. Where have you seen this integration modeled well? Poorly?"

**Question 20**: "What's your unique way of expressing 'Do good'? (teaching, creating, organizing, healing, building, etc.)"

---

### **Deep Dive Discussion Prompts**

#### **Cultural Context**
1. "The book is rooted in Indian military culture and family values. What resonated universally? What required cultural translation for you?"
2. "The father funded his siblings' educations and marriages—a common practice in his culture. How does your culture define family obligation?"

#### **Gender & Roles**
1. "This is a father-son story. How would it differ if it were mother-daughter? Father-daughter? Mother-son?"
2. "The father integrated 'warrior' and 'poet.' How do traditional gender roles make this integration harder? How can we change that?"

#### **Modern Application**
1. "How do you practice 'Be good, Do good' in digital spaces (social media, online work, etc.)?"
2. "The father's generation valued service and sacrifice. How does your generation define success? Has something been lost or gained?"

#### **Personal Growth**
1. "Which chapter made you most uncomfortable? Why?"
2. "If you took the 30-Day Challenge, which day would be hardest for you?"
3. "What ONE practice from this book will you implement in your life?"

---

### **Group Activities**

#### **Activity 2: Legacy Letters (30 minutes)**
Each person writes a brief legacy letter to someone important (child, partner, mentee, friend). Option to read aloud.

- Identify common themes
- Discuss how "Be good, Do good" applies to each

#### **Activity 4: Gratitude Circle (10 minutes)**
Go around the circle. Each person names one person who carried a burden for them and commits to thanking that person this week.

## Tips for Facilitating Great Conversations

**Create Safety**:
- "Share what you're comfortable sharing. Pass if you need to."
- "We listen without judgment. Different perspectives are welcome."
- "What's shared here, stays here."

**Go Deeper**:
- When someone shares, ask: "Tell me more about that."
- Notice what's NOT being said: "What's hard to talk about here?"
- Connect responses: "That reminds me of what [person] said earlier..."

**Keep It Real**:
- Share your own struggles, not just victories
- Admit when you don't have answers
- Focus on progress, not perfection

**End with Action**:
- Don't just discuss—commit to ONE specific action
- Check in at next meeting: "Did you do what you committed to?"
- Celebrate small wins
