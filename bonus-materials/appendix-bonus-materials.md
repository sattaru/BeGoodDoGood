## 🙏 A Final Word on These Resources

These bonus materials exist because **wisdom without practice is just information**.

You've read the book. You understand the principles. Now comes the harder, more important work: living them.

**"Be Good. Do Good." is not a philosophy to admire.  
It's a compass to follow.**

These resources are your navigation tools. Use them. Adapt them. Share them.

Most importantly: **return to them when you drift**.

Because you will drift. We all do.

The question is not whether you'll lose your way. The question is whether you'll have the tools and the courage to return to your compass.

**You have the compass**: Be good. Do good.  
**Now you have the tools**: Five resources for the journey.  
**What remains is the choice**: Will you use them?
