## Card Rituals & Practices

### **Daily Card Draw**
Each morning, shuffle your cards and draw one. That's your focus for the day. Carry it with you. Reflect on it in the evening.

### **Weekly Card Focus**
Choose one card to focus on for an entire week. Place it everywhere (mirror, desk, car, phone). Deep practice beats surface knowledge.

### **Partner Card Exchange**
With a spouse, friend, or accountability partner:
- Each person draws a card
- Share why you need that card today
- Check in at day's end: "Did you live your card?"

### **Family Card Night**
Once a week, each family member:
1. Draws a card
2. Shares a story about when they lived (or failed) that principle
3. Commits to practicing it this week

### **Gifting Cards**
When someone is struggling, give them the card they need:
- Job loss → Card #4 (The Storm)
- Difficult choice → Card #8 (Three-Second Pause)
- Feeling worthless → Card #2 (The Anchor)
- Overwhelmed → Card #13 (Beautiful Burdens)

Write a personal note on the back about why you chose that card for them.
